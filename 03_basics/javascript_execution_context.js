//   phases
//1.memory creation phase 
//2.execution phase



//steps
//1. global execution->this
//2.memory phase(eg val1=undefined, add=definition)
//3.execution phase(ed val1=10,add (new variable environment +execution thread) 
// and because function again call so memory phase and execution phase again works and important thing is that after execution 
// this is deleted)


//Call stack(it works like LIFO)
